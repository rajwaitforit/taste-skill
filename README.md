# taste-skill

General-purpose OpenClaw skill for defining, training, and applying taste profiles.

## What it does

- Converts subjective preferences into a reusable taste profile
- Runs a structured intake (likes, dislikes, vibe, constraints)
- Scores candidate outputs by fit, novelty, and quality/live signal
- Supports repeatable output modes:
  - `run 5`
  - `deep dive`
  - `anti-taste filter`

## Included files

- `SKILL.md` — core skill instructions and workflow
- `intake-template.md` — reusable onboarding questions
- `output-templates.md` — response/output formats

## Typical use cases

- Personal style/aesthetic curation
- Brand mood and reference scouting
- Taste-calibrated product, media, or design recommendations
- Filtering weak-fit options from a candidate list

## Core intake questions

1. What are we curating for?
2. What feeling should it give? (3–5 adjectives)
3. 3 examples you love + why
4. 3 examples you dislike + why
5. Spectrum preferences (safe↔experimental, mainstream↔niche, etc.)
6. Hard constraints or exclusions
7. Preferred output format
8. What defines a successful hit

## Notes

- Prefer active/live links and avoid stale sources.
- Avoid repeating recently rejected references.
- Use latest user feedback as highest-priority signal.
